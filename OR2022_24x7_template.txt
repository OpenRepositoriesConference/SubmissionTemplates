Proposal (no longer than a page)
- Tell us what you will cover in the presentation. Why will your topic be of interest to the intended audience? Successful 24?7 presentations have a clear focus on one idea and a narrower focus than a 30 minute presentation. Talks about failures and lessons learnt are highly encouraged.


- If your 24x7 presentation is very technical it may be more appropriate for the Developer√ïs Track.
- Remember, 24x7 presentations are short (7-minute) presentations.
- Your proposal should be in English and no longer than a page.
